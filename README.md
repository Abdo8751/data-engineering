An Interactive website with valuable insights and dashboards in the making
NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project implements the complete data engineering and visualization pipeline for analyzing motor vehicle collisions in New York City. Using datasets from NYC Open Data, the solution involves cleaning, integrating (joining crash and person/vehicle datasets), and visualizing the integrated data in a fully interactive web dashboard built with *Plotly Dash*.

Yousef Moataz:                                      Led the setup of the project’s Colab notebook and was responsible for the complete data cleaning process, including                                                 both pre- and post-integration phases. Ensured data consistency, handled missing values, and standardized
                                                formats across datasets. Additionally, contributed to the visualization phase by designing and developing an
                                                interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights key insights and supports dynamic data exploration.

Abdelrahman Abualhuda :
