An Interactive website with valuable insights and dashboards in the making
NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project implements the complete data engineering and visualization pipeline for analyzing motor vehicle collisions in New York City. Using datasets from NYC Open Data, the solution involves cleaning, integrating (joining crash and person/vehicle datasets), and visualizing the integrated data in a fully interactive web dashboard built with *Plotly Dash*.

👥 Team Members and Contributions



Yousef Moataz:                                      Led the setup of the project’s Colab notebook and was responsible for the complete data cleaning process, including                                                 both pre- and post-integration phases. Ensured data consistency, handled missing values, and standardized
                                                formats across datasets. Additionally, contributed to the visualization phase by designing and developing an
                                                interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights key insights and supports dynamic data exploration.

Abdelrahman Abualhuda :
Took on the development of the website on a copy of the Colab notebook. Created the navigation logic and handled all necessary imports that we needed in the website. Hosted website on [http://abdelrhman123456.pythonanywhere.com](http://abdelrhman123456.pythonanywhere.com

Rana meligy:               My primary responsibility was the direct implementation and integration of the core analytical visualizations in the dashboard. I developed and                               deployed four crucial components: the Top 10 Contributing Factors bar chart, the Total Crashes Over Time line chart, the Total Injured Persons per                            Borough bar chart, and the Total Killed versus Injured Persons Over Time area chart. This work involved ensuring the underlying data processing                               and accurate representation of these key metrics, forming the backbone of the dashboard's initial functionality and reporting capabilities.
