NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project implements the complete data engineering and visualization pipeline for analyzing motor vehicle collisions in New York City. Using datasets from NYC Open Data, the solution involves cleaning, integrating (joining crash and person/vehicle datasets), and visualizing the integrated data in a fully interactive web dashboard built with *Plotly Dash*.
